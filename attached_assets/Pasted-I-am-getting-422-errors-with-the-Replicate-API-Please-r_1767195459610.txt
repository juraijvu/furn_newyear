I am getting 422 errors with the Replicate API. Please refactor my code to follow the latest official model syntax:Remove hardcoded versions: Instead of using a long version ID string, use the official slug: black-forest-labs/flux-fill-pro for inpainting and meta/sam-2 for segmentation.Fix Image Inputs: Check how images are being passed. If they are local files, ensure they are being converted to Base64 Data URIs or uploaded to a temporary URL before being sent to Replicate.Validation Check: Print the exact error response from replicate.run() to the console so we can see which specific field (e.g., 'mask' or 'image') is causing the validation failure."2. How Replit can check for the right modelsReplit can actually browse the Replicate registry via the API or by looking at the documentation for specific "Collections." Here is how they should find what you need:To find the latest versions: Go to the model's page on Replicate (e.g., replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-fill-pro) and click the "Versions" tab.To use the best "Furniture" tools: They should look at the "Image Editing" and "Object Detection & Segmentation" collections.3. Recommended "Perfect Fit" ModelsFor a furniture customizer, Replit should use these exact models to ensure precision:TaskRecommended ModelWhy it fits your purposeEdge Detectionblack-forest-labs/flux-canny-proIt creates an "outline" of the furniture so the AI knows exactly where the shape is.Object Selectionmeta/sam-2The gold standard for "Segment Anything." It lets users click a chair and gets a pixel-perfect mask.Color/Texture Changeblack-forest-labs/flux-fill-proThis is a "Fill" model. It won't just spread color; it intelligently repaints the area inside the mask while keeping the lighting realistic.4. Technical Checklist for ReplitEnsure the developers are following these "Perfection" rules:Mask Blur: Set mask_blur to a low value (1–3 pixels) to prevent the color from bleeding into the background.Denoising Strength: Set the prompt_strength to 0.5. If it's too high (1.0), the furniture will look completely different; if it's too low (0.1), the color won't change.Prompt Weighting: Use terms like "preserving original texture and shadows" to maintain realism.
